After, I changed the directory into lab7 by typing `cd lab7/`, and ran the test proving it fails using `bash test.sh`  

Next, I typed `vim ListExamples.java` which displayed the code in the fail, I then pressed the `<down>` and `<right>` arrows to navigate to the `index1` that needs to be changed to `index2` in order for the tests to pass.  
**step four**

 In order to change the `1` into `2`, I simply pressed `x`, which deleted the character that the cursor is on, then `i`, which allows you to enter the interface and add a character, then `2`, which changes the value, then `esc` and `:wq` to leave editing mode, save the changes, and exit back to the command line.  
 **step five**

 Then, I retyped `bash test.sh` to show that the tests work after the fix.  
 
 **step six**

Finally, I typed `git add ListExamples.java` then `git commit -m "Fix Failing test", which commits the git file to the repository, after that I typed `git push origin main` which pushed the commit back.
